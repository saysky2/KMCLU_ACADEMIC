# ML-Lab README

This repository contains 8 machine learning lab programs(acording to KMCLU Btech CSE syllabus) organized into separate folders named **Program1**, **Program2**, ..., **Program8**.

Each program folder includes(some may only have python files only ):
- A Python file (e.g., `file_name.py`)
- A dataset file (e.g., `data_set.csv`)

Follow the instructions below to run any program.

## How to Run Each Program

### **Step 1: Open Terminal / Command Prompt**

### **Step 2: Navigate to the ML-Lab folder**
```
cd path/to/ML-Lab
```

### **Step 3: Navigate to the desired program folder (Program1 to Program8)**
Example:
```
cd Program1
```

### **Step 4: Run the Python program**
```
python file_name.py
```
(Use `python3` if required)

---
##  Requirements
Make sure Python is installed on your system.
Recommended versions:
- Python 3.10 or above

Install necessary packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(if provided)

---
##  Notes
- You **must be inside the specific program folder** before running the Python file.
- Make sure the dataset file (CSV) is present in the same folder as the Python file.
- Do not rename the dataset unless you update the code accordingly.

##  Example
```
cd ML-Lab
cd Program3
python em-k_means-algo-compare.py
```
