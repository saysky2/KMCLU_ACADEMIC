    <p>
        MIME is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.

MIME headers are added to the beginning of email messages to provide information about the content type and structure. This allows email clients to interpret and display the message correctly. MIME is crucial for handling different types of content in emails beyond plain text.
