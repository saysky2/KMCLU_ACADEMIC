    <img src="../image/engineers.jpg" alt="Engineers">

    <p><b>Engineers</b>, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who <u>invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials</u> to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost. The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare ("to contrive, devise") and ingenium ("cleverness"). The foundational qualifications of a licensed professional engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations.
